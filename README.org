This is a generalization of an idea by Mickey Petersen of
masteringemacs fame:

Use one keystroke to jump from a code buffer to the corresponding repl
buffer and back again.

This works even if you do other stuff in between, as the last buffer
used to jump to a repl is stored in a buffer local variable in the
repl buffer.

Currently this assumes that the stored command to start the repl will
switch to an already open repl buffer if it exists.

There are no repl/mode combinations preconfigured, put something like
the following in your emacs setup for php and elisp repl:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'repl-toggle)
  (rtog/add-repl 'php-mode 'php-boris ) 
  (rtog/add-repl 'emacs-lisp-mode 'ielm ) 
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-t") 'rtog/toggle-repl)
#+END_SRC
